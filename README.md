# README: BUNGIE JUMPER SIMULATION
<hr style = "border:2px dotted gray"> 

### SUMMARY
 This simulation is test and visualize real world examples of bungie jumping. We will be testing and solving the forces in play on our jumper and visualizing it through animation.

### BACKGROUND:
 The motivation behind this project is to simulate the motion of a person jumping from the ledge with a bungie cord. We will cover the different forces on the person by plotting the trajectory of the person as a projectile obejct. We will also cover the pendulum motion of a spring with a mass on the end and dampened harmonic oscilation due to the elasticity of the cord. We hope to plot this motion and animate it to help vizualize the forces in play on the system. Through our code we can calulate and solve for speed, position, path of motion, and the time of the person bungie jumping until coming to rest. We can test different types of materials to see which has the longest bouncing time, largest amplitude, and the strength of the cord material. We hope to create an accurate simulation that reflects real life situations, including weight limits and differing elasiticity.

### RESOURCES:
 We will refer to the standard regulations for bungie jumping, force equations of torque/ strain on a spring, pendulum motion equations, and projectile motion of an object. We will be including data and code given in our PHYS 360 - COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS clas. (Add more resources as you find them). We will modify the code of our projectile motion and pendulum code, modifying them to simulate a projectile object attached to a spring being dropped or launched from the ledge of a drop. We will incorporate our dampened harmonic oscilator code to simulate the loss in energy over time as the person or object bounces on the string until  the return to rest.

### OBJECTIVES:
 In this simulation we hope to solve the force equations of motion and velocity, spring force, and tension on a spring, and the mass of that string (our bungie jumper) experiencing projectile motion when jumping from the ledge. We hope to find which material makes the best bungie cord by being stong but also being elastic and providing a safe exciting bungie jumping experience. We hope to accurately plot the possible paths of motion and to find the speed, jump time, number of bounces, and height of the bounces over time.
